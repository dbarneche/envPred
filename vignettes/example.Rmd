```{r, message = FALSE}
library(envPred)
```

First, we recommend carefully reading the help page for the main function

```{r, eval = FALSE}
?env_stats
```

To calculate the five environmental statistics (seasonality, colour of environmental noise, predictability, constancy, contingency) using sample data (temporally even SST data):

```{r}
sst_pred <- env_stats(time_series = sst$time_series, dates = sst$dates,
                      n_states = 11, delta = 1, is_uneven = FALSE,
                      interpolate = FALSE, show_warns = TRUE,
                      noise_method = "spectrum")
```

The argument `n_states` is a numeric vector of length 1 containing a somewhat arbitrary number, as Colwell's method divides a continuous variable up into discrete states (read the original [paper](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2307/1940366) for further details). Default (arbitrary) is 11.

The above example threw a warning, which can be addressed in this example by:

```{r, warnings = FALSE}
sst  <-  sst[sst$dates <= as.Date("2007-01-01"), ]
sst_pred <- env_stats(sst$time_series, sst$dates, n_states = 11, delta = 1,
                      is_uneven = FALSE, interpolate = FALSE,
                      show_warns = TRUE, noise_method = "spectrum")
```

The data can be plotted using [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) methods. The user can plot both the de-trended dataset overlaid with the seasonal interpolation,

```{r}
gg_envpred(sst_pred, type = "detrended")
```

or the spectral density on the log-10 scale

```{r}
gg_envpred(sst_pred, type = "spectral")
```

Finally, the package also handles temporally uneven NPP data
with NAs (carefully check warnings), by using the Lomb-Scargle Periodogram from package
[`lomb`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=lomb).

```{r, warning = FALSE}
npp_pred  <-  env_stats(npp$time_series, npp$dates, n_states = 11, delta = 8,
                        is_uneven = TRUE, interpolate = TRUE,
                        show_warns = TRUE, noise_method = "lomb_scargle")
```
