\title{Calculates Constancy (C), Contingency (M), and Predictability (P) metrics from Colwell (1974)
for seasonally varying environmental data. Can be applied to any phenomenon known or suspected to be
periodic or cyclic in time which can be scored for at least two states. Scores from each month in the
cycle are then collected for as many complete cycles as possible, and the data cast as a frequency
matrix with months as columns, and states as rows. See Colwell (1974) for more information.}
\usage{
colwell74(rawTimeSeries, datesVector, nStates = 11)
}
\arguments{
\item{rawTimeSeries}{A \code{\link[base]{numeric}} vector containing 
a raw environmental time series.}

\item{datesVector}{An vector of class \code{\link[base]{Date}} of format YYYY-MM-DD 
(must be in progressive chronological order).}

\item{nStates}{is a \code{\link[base]{numeric}} vector of length 1 containing 
a somewhat arbitrary number, as Colwell's method divides a continuous variable
up into discrete states. Default (arbitrary) is 11. See Details.}
}
\value{
A \code{\link[base]{data.frame}} with three environmental predictability components:
constancy (\code{Colwell_C}), contingency (\code{Colwell_M}) and predictability (\code{Colwell_P}).
Constancy (C) measures the extent to which the environment is the same for all months in all years. 
Contingency (M) measures the extent to which the environmental differences between months are the same 
in all years. Predictability (P) is the sum of Constancy (C) and Contingency (M). Maximum predictability 
can be attained as a consequence of either complete constancy, complete contingency, or a combination 
of constancy and contingency.
